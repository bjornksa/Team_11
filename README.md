Vision:

JustGO! - A trip planner

An application for anyone who travels.
It will offer an intuitive design, great user experience and rich number of features.
Core point of the application - a list of trips.
It will allow to plan a perfect trip and to share it between friends or family, so that everyone stays on the same page.

A trip contains:

● List of destinations

● Pictures and Videos

● Graphical timeline

● Planned or recommended activities

● Co-travellers

● Routes

● Accommodation

● Transportation

● Costs

● And many more
